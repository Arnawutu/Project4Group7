Which country has the lowest risk for heart attack risk prevention

## Possible Questions

### What is the distribution of heart attack risk in the data set?

* Understanding the distribution of the target variable ("Heart Attack Risk") can provide insights into the balance of positive and negative instances. This information is crucial for addressing potential class imbalance issues.

### Which features are the most important predictors of heart attack risk?

* Employ feature importance techniques from models like random forests or gradient boosting to identify the features that contribute the most to predicting heart attack risk.

### Can we create a model to predict heart attack risk with a high level of accuracy?

* Use classification models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines) to train and evaluate the performance of the model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

### What is the predicted probability of a heart attack for each individual in the dataset?

* Utilize models like logistic regression that provide probability estimates. This can help in understanding the model's confidence in its predictions for each individual.

## Can the model provide insights into the key risk factors for heart attacks based on learned patterns?

* Analyze the coefficients or feature importance scores from the model to understand which features contribute significantly to the prediction. This can provide insights into the key risk factors identified by the model.
